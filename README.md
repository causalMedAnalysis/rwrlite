# rwrlite
rwrlite is a stata module to perform causal mediation analysis using regression-with-residuals. The command is lite version of {cmd:rwrmed}, which strips out some functionality for simplicity. Two models are estimated: a linear model for the mediator conditional on treatment and the baseline covariates (if specified) after centering them around their sample means, and a linear model for the outcome conditional on treatment, the mediator, the baseline covariates (if specified) after centering them around their sample means, and the post-treatment covariates (if specified) after centering them around their estimated conditional means given all prior variables. Thus, {cmd:rwrlite} allows for the presence of exposure-induced confounders, which are post-treatment covariates that confound the mediator-outcome relationship.
